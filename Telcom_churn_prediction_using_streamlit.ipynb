        "### Brief Intro on Telecommunication \n",
        " Telecommunication sector is one of the major growing sectors in term of revenue and technology. An **interesting** part of this sector is still the plain old telephone calls is the biggest revenue generator.  But due to advancement in technology, Telecom is growing less about voice and increasingly about video, text, and data which inturn directly increasing the revenue\n",
