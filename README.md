>* Customer retention is less costlier than that of acquiring new customers
>* keeping the churn rate at a minimum in simple terms means more profit or revenue

>**Questions To Think About:**
>- What if the model gives a false positive and the company/stakeholders gives compensation to that individual? Who should be held responsible?
>- Who is gonna consume our model?  Who are the stakeholders? Who do we need to convince that our work is good/useful?
>- What are the risks? How accurate or precise will our results be?
>- How are we checking the error rate? Is there a error handling mechanism for it?
>- What if our eventual model makes mistakes (it will) - are some mistakes more costly than others?
>- Could we be held liable for those mistakes?
